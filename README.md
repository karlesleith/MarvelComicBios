## Submittion to the Windows Store

## Development
During the process of development I learned how to use an  API, making calls to a external database, building models to take in the data and data bind the data to object on the XAML UI. Due to the function of the application, internet access is always needed to sync to the API, I provided a load ring to make the user aware of progress as it is retrieving  the data.
